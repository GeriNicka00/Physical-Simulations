    "## Part 1 - Cosmic Ray Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simulate the response of the detector, we need a simulation of the incoming particles. Here we will consider cosmic rays, which we will simulate using a Monte Carlo method.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the Earth's surface, cosmic rays are essential all muons.  To a good approximation, they have a distribution in zenith angle $\\theta$ which is proportional to ${\\rm cos}^2(\\theta)$, and are uniform in polar angle $\\phi$. We can assume they are uniformly distributed in the horizontal plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the energy of the cosmic muon needs to be modelled, the distribution can be very crudely approximated in units of GeV/C by a log-normal distribution with $\\mu=6.55$ and $\\sigma=1.8$.  If the charge needs to be modelled, cosmic rays at the Earth's surface comprise approximately 30% more $\\mu^+$ than $\\mu^-$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that will randomly generate a cosmic ray muon each time it is called.  The function should return at least a direction in 3D, given the above distributions, as well as a starting position on a user definable horizontal plane.  Show that your function produces the desired distributions, at least qualitatively, by calling it for a large number of trials."

    "## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING APPROACH\n",
    "\n",
    "### Particle():\n",
    "\n",
    "A class which includes all distributions of the variables of interest was constructed. All these distributions are stored in the `Main_Generator()` function. This function, generates a muon from all distributions of interest and returns a direction and energy. This function does not return any output but stores all values as object attributes. This is essential for the second part of this assignment. To be more clear, it enables the programme to pass a single parameter which contains all the variables required to construck the muons track through the drift chamber. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that since the Zenith angle distribution does not have an analytical inverse an Accept/Reject method was implemented to generate it. The Azimuthial angle distribution is uniform, meaning that `np.random.random()` is suitable for the generation of uniformly distributed values. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was given in the assignment the the momentum is LogNormally distributed with mean equal to 6.55 and standard deviation equal to 1.8. To generate results a Numpy routine was followed. More specifically, `np.random.lognormal(mu, sigma)` was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the horizontal plane above the drift chamber where muons come from random numbers for the x and y coordinates where generated using Numpy. The size of the plane is 2 by 2 meters which is significantly larger than the drift chamber, allowing muons to enter from the sides as well. Demonstrators also confirmed that this is correct. The charge distribution of muons had to be generated carefully, as we are given that for cosmic ray muons there's an excess of positive muons by 30%. As a result, a random number was generated and splitted into a 1.3 : 1 ratio for every muon. The end result is a distribution of muons which each time has a 30% percent excess of positive muons. This is also validated by the `Charge_Ratio_Validation()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "All results except for coordinates(in S.I. units) were calculated and presented in natural units. The reason for this is that in natural units, mass, energy, momentum and charge are not close to the machine epsilon and errors are avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing the Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the distributions function `Plotter_to_Verify()` was defined. This visualises the distributions by plotting the relevant histrograms for the generated variables, namely momentum, Zenith angles and Azimuthial angles. All three histograms plotted at first look behave as expected. However, to increase the confidence of the results the line of best fit was fitted into the histograms. The end result is a validation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for a much more quantitative comparison of the histrograms to the expected values the residuals of each bin where plotted, showing by what fraction the results differ from the expected values. These differences were visualised in the form of histograms as well. The mean and standard deviation of the residuals is obtained by implementing the `Residual_Analysis` function. This prints the mean and standard deviation of each residual plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was crucial to ensure that the initial positions of the generated muons are evenly distributed. If not then results for the ionisation of the Argon gas in the second part of this assignment will most likely be misleading. To validate the even distribution of muons, a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimate was calculated using the `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde` method. The implementation was performed by closely consulting the Official Documentation of Scipy. The Gaussian KDE plot verifies the fact that muons are evenly distributed across the horizontal 2 dimensional plane above the drift chamber. This gives a more quantitative nature to the results, which is always more formal and raises no doubts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Improvement - A more realistic approach to the Muons energies\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching through literature, it was found the typical cosmic muons energies range between 4-6 GeV. In the present simulation, the energies of the generated muons range between one and two orders of magnitude higher than the literature values. This suggests that in the assignment handout, the mean and standard deviation given are not of the logarithmic distribution but of the normal. However the assignment still claims these are of the underlying lognormal distribution. For this sole reason the mean and standard deviation given were used in the lognormal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The improvement proposed is based on the mean and standard deviation being of the normal distribution, meaning that they need to be converted in order to be placed in the parameters of the lognormal distribution. Various sources on statistics and statistical modelling agree that the formulae which can convert the mean and stardard deviation are:\n",
    "$$\\mu=\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{X}^{2}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{X}^{2}+\\sigma_{X}^{2}}}\\right)$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^{2}=\\ln \\left(1+\\frac{\\sigma_{X}^{2}}{\\mu_{X}^{2}}\\right)\n",
    "$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is expected the generate muons with energies which are much closer to the literature value. However this would change the visualisation of the momentum distribution which itself was given to be lognormal. Under different circumstances the proposed imporvement would have been implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some remarks and References used for Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Every histogram is within the expected distribution as the means of their residuals are very close to zero and within one standard deviation of zero. The momentum and Zenith angle distributions always exhibit a few residual outliers, always at the tail ends of the distributions, due to a very low probability. In other words they are vulnerable to random fluctuations which give rise to the relatively large residuals.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Part 2 - Ionisation\n",
    "\n",
    "When a charged particle, such as a cosmic ray muon, traverses the wire chamber, it will ionise gas molecules. In order to model this ionisation, we can assume the muon loses negligible energy while traversing the detector, and liberates a fixed number of electrons per unit distance. For the Ar in the drift chamber we are modelling, you can assume 94 electrons are liberated per cm.  (A more sophisticated extension would use a Monte Carlo method to model variations in the number of liberated electrons as the muon traverses the chamber.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing the code\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write a function which takes the starting position and direction of a randomly generated cosmic ray as input, and returns a 2D array representing the initial ionisation caused by the cosmic ray.  In order to achieve this, you may wish to first write a function which calculates the length of a track traversing a grid cell, given the track parameters and grid cell location. You should test your code by generating a few cosmic rays and plotting the resulting charge distribution."

    "### Detector Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class produces the output of a matrix which gives the charge distribution induced by the track of the muons inside the drift chamber. Once again, the object oriented programming approach was followed as it made the implementation of multiple functions as methods to incorporate a number of extensions. Extensions include the implementation of magnetic fields in the chamber, energy loss due to primary ionisation and Bethe-Bloch energy loss. Moreover, OOP allows for a more clear, compact and concise code, in which many arguments can be passed through the methods without clashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ionisation - The approach\n",
    "\n",
    "First of the equation describing ionisation must be implemented in a vectorised form, such that the output is a matrix with the charge density at each position. The vectorised equation for this is :\n",
    "$$ \\vec{r_{n+1}} = \\vec{r_{n}} + \\vec{v}dt $$\n",
    "It makes more sense physically to show the position of the particle in space rather than time. Thus, timesteps had to be  converted to spatial steps along the ionisation the path. The conversion of a timestep to spatial step is given by: \n",
    "$$dt = \\frac{dl}{v}$$ \n",
    "Finally the position is given by:\n",
    "$$ \\vec{r_{n+1}} = \\vec{r_{n}} + \\vec{v}\\frac{dl}{v} $$\n",
    "which is dependent on $\\frac{\\vec{v}}{v}$. In other words, only the direction of the particle, ensuring a constant accuracy in the prediction of position of the muons regardless of their incoming momentum. This method also takes into account the presence of a magnetic field in the chamber.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure than the visualisation of the ionisation in the Argon gas is accurate and of high resolution, the spatial step is set to be considerably smaller than the gridsize of the image. More specifically, the length of each line in one grid of the image is computed to a high degree of accuracy. The final result of the ionisation track is visualized with a high level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Magnetic Field and Lorentz Force \n",
    "\n",
    "The generated muons move at approximately the speed of light so relativistic Lorentz Force was required given by the vectorised equation:\n",
    "$$ \\vec{p_{n+1}} = \\vec{p_n} + q( \\vec{E} + \\vec{v}x\\vec{B})\\frac{dl}{v}$$\n",
    "where $\\vec{p} = \\gamma m v$ is the relativistic momentum. Momentum values are updated at each step. The process is exactly the same as in the ionisation approach described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bethe - Bloch and Energy Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bethe-Bloch formula describes the mean energy loss per distance travelled of swift charged particles traversing matter. Electrons have a different energy loss due to their small mass which requires relativistic corrections. Moreover, they are subject to larger losses due to Bremsstrahlung, so terms must be added to account for this. Fast charged particles moving through matter interact with the electrons of atoms in the material, in this case Argon gas. The interaction excites or ionizes the atoms, leading to an energy loss of the travelling particle. The energy lost as muons traverse through is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-\\left\\langle\\frac{d E}{d x}\\right\\rangle=K z^{2} \\frac{Z}{A} \\frac{\\rho}{\\beta^{2}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\frac{2 m_{e} \\beta^{2} \\gamma^{2} T_{\\max }}{I^{2}}-\\beta^{2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where K is a constant, Z is the atomic number of the Argon gas, A its mass number, z the electric charge in electron charge units, I the mean excitation potential, ρ the density of Argon gas in the chamber and $T_{max}$ the maximum kinetic energy transfered in a collision:\n",
    "$$T_{\\max }=\\frac{2 m_{e} \\beta^{2} \\gamma^{2}}{1+2 \\gamma m_{e} / M+\\left(m_{e} / M\\right)^{2}}$$\n",
    "where M is the mass of the muon(incident particle).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Landau Distribution by Moyal Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of ionised electrons and the energy loss follow the Landau distribution, which is approximated by the Moyal distribution(as Dr. James Brooke pointed out) given by:\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\frac{\\exp ( \\frac{-x + e^{-x}}{2})}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} $$\n",
    "This approximation is accurate for more than 5 ionisations per centimeter. For Argon there are 24.3 primary ionisations per centimeter, rendering the Moyal approximation appropriate. `scipy.moyal.rvs` was used to generate a random Moyal distribution with a certain mean and variance. This method needs to take a location and scale parameter which were converted from mean and variance following: \n",
    "$$ \\bar{x} = \\mu + \\sigma (\\text{EulerGamma} + \\ln (2)) $$\n",
    "$$ \\text{var} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\sigma^2}{2} $$.\n",
    "These equations and the general method are available through the official documentation of the Scipy library. \n",
    "Since, no literature value for the variace of ionisations or energy loss was available, the most accurate estimate was produced using Poisson variance(again consulting Dr. James Brooke).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the Distributions for Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions `Bethe-Bloch` and `Energy_Loss_and_Moyal_Dist_Verification` where tested to ensure the distributions are correct.\n",
    "The Bethe-Bloch energy loss curve shows an energy loss of a few GeV which is too low, so the chance of a muon losing all of its kinetic energy in the chamber is extremely low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy loss due to Bethe-Bloch is greater than the energy lost due to primary ionisation. This is expected as muons ionise electrons with with a high kinetic energy. Primary ionisations in Argon account for 33.3 percent of the total ionisations. As a result, at the minimum energy lost, 25.2 electrons per centimeter are primarily ionised. The total is 94 per centimeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary ionisations are proportional to the energy lost by the Bethe Bloch in the present case. Thus the minimum energy loss is determined in order to scale primary ionisations with the energy loss. It is assumed that total ionisations are proportional to the primary ionisations. `Freed Electrons` method take care of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Moyal approximation of the Landau distribution confirms the desired curve. Residuals plots and their mean and standard deviation also confirm the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments on the Ionisation Tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of an electric field only the ionisation tracks would be straight lines. However, this is not a very interesting topic. The magnetic field added gives rise to much more interesting ionisation tracks. The tracks are curved due to the Lorentz force. Sometimes less energetic muons which suffer from the Lorentz force will continue to follow curved tracks with a decreasing radius of curvature as their kinetic energy is decreasing due to the effect of the Lorentz force. This why sometimes a conical shape track is observed. The magnetic and electric fields have been defined as 3D vectors and tweaked such that the effect of the magnetic field on the tracks is high.\n",

    "# Part 3 - Drift-Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The charge produced by ionisation will drift towards the anode wires, where it can be detected.  However, it will also diffuse in the gas.  These two 'transport' processes are described by the drift-diffusion equation  :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 q - \\frac{1}{\\mu} {\\bf E} \\cdot (\\nabla q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $q(x,y)$ represents the charge distribution in 2D.  The first term on the RHS represents diffusion, the second represents the charge drift under the influence of the electric field.\n",
    "\n",
    "By expanding in terms of (x,y) this can be written :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t} = D\\frac{\\partial^2 q}{\\partial x^2} + D\\frac{\\partial^2 q}{\\partial y^2} - \\frac{E_x}{\\mu}\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{E_x}{\\mu}\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the diffusion terms, we will use the same implicit finite difference scheme described in lectures and the previous assignment, but expanded to 2D.  For the drift terms, we will use the 1st order backward difference, also known as the \"upwind\" scheme (since the backward difference is \"upwind\" of the electrostatic force direction).  There are other choices (eg. the 2nd order centred difference) but these are prone to non-physical oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full finite difference equation is then :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{q^{n+1}_{i,j} - q^n_{i,j}}{\\tau} = D\\frac{q^{n+1}_{i-1,j} - 2q^{n+1}_{i,j} + q^{n+1}_{i+1,j}}{h^2} + D\\frac{q^{n+1}_{i,j-1} - 2q^{n+1}_{i,j} + q^{n+1}_{i,j+1}}{h^2} - \\frac{E_x}{\\mu}\\frac{(q^{n+1}_{i,j}- q^{n+1}_{i-1,j})}{2h} - \\frac{E_y}{\\mu}\\frac{(q^{n+1}_{i,j}-q^{n+1}_{i,j-1})}{2h}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can simplify this by assuming the electric field is uniform and non-zero in the x-direction only :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q^n_{i,j} = - \\alpha q^{n+1}_{i-1,j} - \\alpha q^{n+1}_{i+1,j} - \\alpha q^{n+1}_{i,j-1} - \\alpha q^{n+1}_{i,j+1} + (1+4\\alpha) q^{n+1}_{i,j} - \\beta q^{n+1}_{i-1,j} + \\beta q^{n+1}_{i,j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha = \\frac{D \\tau}{h^2}$ and $\\beta = \\frac{\\tau E}{2\\mu h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or collecting terms relating to the same node :\n",
    "$$q^n_{i,j} = ( - \\alpha- \\beta) q^{n+1}_{i-1,j} - \\alpha q^{n+1}_{i+1,j} - \\alpha q^{n+1}_{i,j-1} - \\alpha q^{n+1}_{i,j+1} + (1+4\\alpha+\\beta) q^{n+1}_{i,j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an implicit equation, expressing $q^n$ in terms of $q^{n+1}$ for a node and its neighbours. Just as for the 1D diffusion problem, we will need to solve the equation for each timestep, and iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "And again just like the 1D diffusion problem, we can represent this finite difference equation as a matrix.  However, there is an added complication because we now have a 2D grid.  What we have to do is represent each node in the 2D grid systematically as a row (or column) of the matrix.  This means if we have a grid of size $n_i \\times n_j$, the matrix will need to be $n_i n_j \\times n_i n_j$.  One way of systematically mapping nodes onto rows/columns of the matrix is to use \"row-major ordering\", where the matrix index $k$ corresponding to grid node $(i,j)$ is $k = n_ij + i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the 2D grid is stored in a row-major ordered vector, then we can write the finite difference equation as a matrix equation :\n",
    "$$q^n = M q^{n+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a small example, if $n_i=n_j=4$, then matrix M is $16 \\times 16$ and its top-left quadrant ($8 \\times 8$) is  :\n",

    "}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the diagonals continue into the remaining quadrants.  This is a \"tri-diagonal matrix with fringes\".  It comprises five diagonal elements corresponding to the five terms in the previous equation.  The tri-diagonal part corresponds to the terms for $(i-1, j)$, $(i,j)$ and $(i+1, j)$ while the fringes are the terms for $(i, j-1)$ and $(i, j+1)$.  In terms of the matrix coordinate $k$, the fringe diagonals start at $(0,n_i)$ and $(n_i,0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of additional terms, the matrix equation above possesses a \"periodic boundary condition\".  Effectively, this means any charge leaving the grid on one edge will re-appear on the opposite edge, which is adequate for our purposes here."

    "### Writing the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the 2D drift-diffusion equation is conceptually similar to the 1D diffusion equatino you have already encountered.  The differences are : the changes needed to handle a 2D grid of nodes, and the $\\beta$ term in the matrix M to accomodate charge drift.\n",

    "Next,  write a function which iteratively solves the matrix equation $q^n = M q^{n+1}$ for each timestep, using an appropriate routine from scipy.  This function should take a 2D array of the charge distribtuion as input. However, you will need to convert this to a 1D array in order to solve the matrix equation.  **Hint** : You can use `ndarray.flatten()` to convert a 2D array into a row-major ordered 1D array, and you can use `ndarray.reshape(ny, nx)` to convert a 1D row-major ordered array back into a 2D array.\n",

    "### Why use a sparse matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "A sparse matrix is generated using the `Sparse_Matrix_Construction` and `Matrix_Generator` functions. There are many zeros and the matrix of size $N_y*N_z$ is very large. A sparse matrix algorithm is less dense than other conventional matrix solving methods and considerably faster. The 'csc' format is used as it is the most compatible with this method according to official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to eliminate periodic boundary conditions, it was demanded that elements from the edges of the grids do not interfere with each other. To achieve this, the grid dimensions were set as $N_y \\times N_z$ for every element in $N_y$ which is then removed from the off-diagonals near the centre of the matrix. This removes any periodic boundary conditions and makes the whole procedure more straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Compute` flattens the relevant array and implements `scipy.sparse.linalg.factorized` to factorise the matrix using LU decomposition outside the iterative loop, finally solving the matrix equation inside the iterative loop. According to the official documentation this is the fastest method to execute these computationally demanding calculations, especially when using a 'csc' format.\n",

    "#### Results for Drift - Diffusion ( This is an initial test to ensure the algorithm operates as required. )\n",
    "\n",
    "As required the algorithm is first tested for a point charge and the effects of drift, diffusion and drift-diffusion in different directions where visualised.\n",

    "1) Diffusion - Isotropic spreading out of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Drift - Charge drifts to right and is spread out by the EM field.\n",
    "\n",

    "The images plotted above confirm that algorithm functions properly and gives rise to accurate physical modelling. \n",

    "#### Important note for the 7th plot of diagonal drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a bit concerning that in the 7th plot we see drift diffusion instead of just diagonal drift. There is an explanation of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about it in depth, one can figure out that inducing drift in 2 directions will inevitably spread out the charge distribution, producing a diffusion like image. This happens because the grid is constructed such that there are only horizontal and vertical directions. There are not any diagonal directions. Physically, there is no spreading of the charge in diagonal diffusion, this is an effect of the simulation worth noting. \n",

    "Combining classes `Particle` and `Detector` from Parts 1 and 2 respectively, as well as the functions from Part 3 the following simulation has been successfully performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "A random muon out of all the generated muons enters the drift chamber at random entry point, which is either from the top or the sides and then exits. Due to magnetic field being present along the electric field, the entry and exit points are not connected by a straight line. As long as the muon is inside the chamber it transfers its kinetic energy(which is modelled using Bethe-Bloch) to the Argon atom electrons, causing them to leave the atom, in other words ionisation takes place. Incorporating both the `Particle Class` and Part 3 functions the drift-diffusion was successfully modelled as shown above including a magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current \n",
    "\n",
    "The current along a random wire at the end of the chamber was also visualised using the `Current_Plotter` function. It is important to note that the visualisation of the current is only possible if the drift-diffusion is allowed to reach the end of the chamber. To do that the simulation is allowed to run for an appropriate time and the drift diffusion is visualised at different stages. The current is plotted is always using the data from last image of the drift diffusion, so if the drift diffusion in the last picture has not almost fully passed through the RHS of the image the current will have not reach zero again."
